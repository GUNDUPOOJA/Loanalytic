# Loanalytic
The purpose of Loanalytic-Web is to make the life of the borrower easy by simply registering to an online portal and get a loan approval. The application deals with 3 kinds of loans: Mortgage, Personal and Education loan. The user can quickly choose the kind of loan he wants and the amount he wants to borrow. Loan request would be validated by the application automatically as soon as the user answers few questions based on the kind of loan. The feasibility of loan approval would be displayed immediately. If the criteria is not met the user would be notified immediately else a background check is performed by the admin and a manual notification is sent by the admin. The application gives an opportunity to the admin to verify the user by validating the documents he has uploaded and doing some criminal/background check.  Above all, we hope to provide a comfortable user experience along with the best pricing available.
